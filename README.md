## 2. Business Problem


A prominent retail company with both physical and online operations struggles to effectively target its diverse customer base with relevant marketing campaigns. To address this, the company plans to leverage customer profiling and segmentation techniques to deliver personalized experiences, aiming to boost customer satisfaction, engagement, and spending.


## 3. Challenges:

<b>Diverse Customer Base:</b> The retail chain has customers â€“ with different age distribution, different shopping patterns, and they like different things. Trying to use the same marketing for everyone doesn't work anymore because each group of customers is unique.

<b>Segmentation Complexity:</b> Due to the large customer base, which consists of over 2000 individuals, and the extensive information collected about each customer, it has become a complex task to identify the unique spending behaviors and patterns within various customer segments.

<b>Ineffective Campaigns:</b> Some marketing campaigns are generic and lack personalization. As a result, they don't stand out or feel special to the customers.

## 4. Objectives:

The main aim of this project is to develop a strategy for understanding customers and sorting them into different groups. This will allow the retail chain to send personalized marketing messages. The project seeks to accomplish the following goals:

1. Create a plan to gather detailed information about customers and categorize them into different types.
   
2. Use these methods to help the store improve its performance and attract more customers who will enjoy their products.
